Java Lambda Expressions: An Overview and Guide
Lambda expressions, introduced in Java 8, brought a fresh breath of functional programming style to Java. These are anonymous functions that provide a concise way to represent functional interfaces, making our code more readable and reducing its verbosity.

## What are Lambda Expressions?

Syntax:

```bash
(parameters) -> expression
