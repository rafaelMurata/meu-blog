## Understanding the abstract Keyword in Java
When it comes to object-oriented programming, the word abstract is one of the fundamental pillars. In Java, the word abstract is one of the main mechanisms for achieving this abstraction.

## What is data abstraction?
In computer science, abstraction represents one of the fundamental principles, it refers to the process of hiding complex and unnecessary details of the system, aiming at high-level concerns about functionalities.

## What does abstract mean in Java?
In simple terms, abstract is a keyword that indicates that something is incomplete or cannot be instantiated directly. In the context of Java, you can find abstract classes and methods.

## Abstract Classes
A class marked as abstract cannot be instantiated directly, but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all abstract methods in its parent class. However, if this does not happen, the subclass must also be declared abstract.

In other words, you cannot create an object of this class using the new operator. An abstract class is generally used as a base class for other classes.

```java
abstract class Animal {
     abstract void sound();
}
```
In this example, Animal is an abstract class that has an abstract method called sound.

## Abstract Methods

An abstract method is a method that has no body. He only has one statement. If a class has even just one abstract method, the entire class must be declared abstract.
```java
abstract class Animal {
     abstract void sound();
}
```
Here, sound is an abstract method. Classes that extend Animal need to provide an implementation for this method.

## Why Use abstract?
The idea behind abstract classes and methods is to provide a structure. Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, thus guaranteeing a specific contract that subclasses must follow.

For example:
```java
class Dog extends Animal {
     void sound() {
         System.out.println("The dog barks");
     }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
     void sound() {
         System.out.println("The cat meows");
     }
}
```
Here, both Dog and Cat are subclasses of Animal and both provide their own implementation of the sound method.

## Important Considerations
* An abstract class can have variables, constructor methods and concrete methods (methods with body).
* If a subclass does not provide implementations for all of the abstract methods of the abstract parent class, then the subclass must also be marked as abstract.
* Abstract methods cannot be private or final.
* A class cannot be both abstract and final.

## Conclusion
The abstract keyword provides a powerful mechanism for abstraction in Java. It helps ensure a contract between base classes and subclasses, allowing for a clear structure and facilitating code maintenance and expansion. By understanding and correctly using abstract classes and methods, developers can create more modular and scalable systems.
